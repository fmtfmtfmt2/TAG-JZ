				After being accepted into the program for the first time, I became a <span>Junior Zookeeper (JZ)</span>. Junior Zookeepers are the volunteers aged 11 and 12. As the name suggests, a JZ is literally a "junior zookeeper", meaning that we do many of the the things that a zookeeper does, including the nasty stuff.

				<span>Goat Yard</span>- The goat yard was probably the most busy area one could have worked in when volunteering. Because it's so busy, we had to watch the yard with extra caution in order to ensure the safety of the animals and the safety of the guests. We did many tasks, such as feeding them, cleaning and replenishing their water bowls, making sure that visitors abide by the Goat Yard rules, and, of course, cleaning up their feces.
