				After being accepted into the program for the first time, I became a <span>Junior Zookeeper (JZ)</span>. Junior Zookeepers are the volunteers aged 11 and 12.<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2WbgcXo.png"; align="left"; id="JZLogo"; style="height:150px" /> As the name suggests, a JZ is literally a "junior zookeeper", meaning that we do many of the the things that a zookeeper does, including the messy stuff.

				<span>Possible places to work:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Goat Yard</span>- The goat yard was probably the most busy area one could have worked in when volunteering. Because<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8hkdA4o.png"; id="chimp"; style="height:275px"; align="right" /> it's so busy, we had to watch the yard with extra caution in order to ensure the safety of the animals and the safety of the guests. We did many tasks, such as feeding them, cleaning and replenishing their water bowls, making sure that visitors abide by the Goat Yard rules, and, of course, cleaning up their feces.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Barn</span>- The Barn is the the area where you do the most of the heavy work,<img src="http://dallas.citymomsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/03/The-Barn-2.jpg; id="chimp"; style="width:150px; />" like cleaning drainage gutters, cleaning horse stalls, washing food and water dishes, and dusting the water filtration system. While some of the activities don't seem very important or of priority, they all contribute into making the Childrens Zoo environment safe for the animals and welcoming for the zoo visitors.
